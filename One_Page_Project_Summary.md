## Project Overview
- Designed and implemented a normalized relational database modeling customer and credit activity.
- Enforced data integrity via foreign keys and constraints across four core tables: customers, accounts, transactions, and credit_scores.
- Populated with synthetic data: 500+ customers, 1,000+ accounts, 10,000+ transactions, and 12 months of credit scores.

## Key Analytical Workflows

- **Net Monthly Flow:** Computed net inflow/outflow by month (deposits vs. withdrawals).
- **Top 5 Customers:** Ranked by total transaction volume.
- **Credit Score Trends:** Averaged monthly scores over the past 6 months.

## Outcomes & Impact
- Delivered a fully functional prototype for transaction analytics.
- Demonstrated skills in database design, ETL automation, and performance-optimized SQL.
- Created a scalable foundation for dashboard integration and advanced analytics.

## Next Steps
- Integrate Python/Pandas for deeper statistical analysis and visualizations.
- Develop interactive dashboards using Power BI or Dash.
- Extend the schema to include branches, loans, and fraud detection features.
